This repo holds the KindCue web app, built as a single-page React application with an LLM/agentic backend and a hosted Postgres database (via Supabase).


Frontend
Vite – build tooling / dev server
React – SPA front-end
TypeScript – type safety across the app
shadcn-ui – unstyled, accessible UI primitives
Tailwind CSS – utility-first styling framework

Backend / Data
Supabase (inferred from the supabase/ folder and PLpgSQL usage)
Postgres database (workouts, user data, history, etc.)
SQL / PLpgSQL functions and possibly RLS policies 
GitHub

AI Layer
Actual LLM provider & keys are configured via environment variables (see .env in the root of the repo).
The app uses GPT4oMini for workout generation
